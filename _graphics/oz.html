<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Description</h5>
<p>
  A personal design challenge I made in my freshman year in college. OZ Corporation is just a fictional name that I thought of, but later found out that itâ€™s used everywhere. I have no intention of infringing any rights whatsoever. I made the main text look as if it were a solid steel. I mixed some gradients underneath the smooth abstract waves and they turned out looking great.
