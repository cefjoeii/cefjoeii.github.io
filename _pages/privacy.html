<p class="txt-size-lead">I take privacy seriously as much as you do &mdash; you’re here to browse my website, not get tracked and be spied on. So I’ve taken the steps to track as little as possible about you and ensure that this information is kept private.</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 30px;">
  <li>I use Google Analytics so I can better understand who the visitors of my website are and where they are coming from.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 15px;">An inaccurate geographic information is embedded when you use the contact form on my website. I use this estimated information to better understand who and where the person I’m getting in touch with is. I keep this including the information you provide on the contact form with tight security and utmost confidentiality. You may choose not to use the contact form.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 30px;">I may update this privacy policy from time to time. If you have questions, suggestions, or other feedback, please get in touch through my email cefjoeii@gmail.com.</p>
