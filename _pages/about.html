            At a young age, I was so interested in electricity and machinery. I always made my own toys from scrap. One time, I tried manually spinning a <strong>TAMIYA</strong> motor and attaching a red LED to it. To my surprise, a tiny light showed up. I accidentally discovered this reversing of the flow of electricity.

            Unlike the other kids who start <strong>computer programming</strong> at a young age, it has never crossed my mind. When I was a kid, I would make an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGFbNISZGxg" target="_blank">electric toy boat</a>, go hiking, gaze at the dusk sky, or do other things. Yet, I got exposure and access to old computers sent by my relatives from the US. Before I entered my teenage years, I’ve already broken the OSs of our computers. Being new, I realised that I messed up the system files while exploring and experimenting. I was not really an Internet person back then and we weren’t connected. So I had to solve the issue on my own. Luckily, I accidentally managed to get into a BIOS setup. I used to play around Windows 98, 2000, and XP. I have no regrets of breaking these things since I learned and discovered how to format such machines.

            In high school, I would teach myself <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> during holidays. In our freshman year, we created a <strong>hello world</strong> application in Visual Basic. High school was when I also got interested in music and moved away from my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9h6FC6QgU" target="_blank">tinkering</a> hobbies. In our senior year, we had a project using HTML.

            My friends and I began playing the <strong>guitar</strong>. We joined a small youth organisation in our village and learned other musical instruments. To give back, we taught the younger kids to play during summer and holidays for their stage performance.

            I entered college and in my freshman year, I didn’t know what my course <strong>Computer Science</strong> is really all about. It was suggested to me by my older engineer cousin. I followed his advice and after a few weeks, I realised that we’ve made the right choice since I really enjoyed understanding and building things.

            As part of our university requirements, I took my internship at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cloudstaff/" target="_blank">Cloudstaff</a>, a fun and friendly workplace. I got trained with a team of students and they eventually became my friends. There were so many fun activities and parties here.

    <ul>
      <li>
        I watch documentaries and read books that interest me: <em>biography</em>, <em>history</em>, <em>technology</em>, and etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Great people like <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong>, <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>, and <strong>Bill Gates</strong> inspire me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Financially literate people like <strong>Grant Cardone</strong>, <strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>, and <strong>Dan Lok</strong> educate me.
      </li>
      <li>
        I value education more than entertainment. I end up watching Neanderthals, Human Evolution, History of World Civilisation, Mongolian Empire, WW2, and other related videos online.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love self-improvement books and videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/phuckmediocrity/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=da" target="_blank">FightMediocrity</a> is one of the YouTube channels I am subscribed to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every day, I learn <em>Stoicism</em> and <em>Zen</em> to gain wisdom.
      </li>
      <li>
        I should probably give time to learn the culture, tradition, and language of different countries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Music and playing the guitar used to be my passion. Not much anymore.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ve rescued a few abandoned kittens since I was a kid. I just can’t see these poor animals die and not do something. Some survive while others don’t. People who throw these little animals away while they still can’t survive on their own need to get their crap together.
